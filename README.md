Complex styled selectors with `,` seem to break

Using `first-of-type` OR `last-of-type` work, but using them both doesn't (it should)

Testing:

```sh
$ # Install bun if you haven't!
$ curl bun.sh/install | bash;
$ # You may need to reload your terminal for bun to be available
$ # Generate *.bun files
$ bun bun --use next
$ # Start dev server
$ bun
```
